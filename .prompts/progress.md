# Project Progress Log

This document tracks recent significant developments and achievements for the Thumby Codefall project.

## Recent Achievements (Corresponds to Milestone Updates)

### Enhanced Depth & Visuals (Milestones 1 & 2)
*   **Increased Depth Layers:** The simulation now uses 5 distinct depth layers, up from the initial 3, providing a richer sense of depth.
*   **Multiple Glyph Sets:** Implemented small (3x6), medium (4x8), and large (5x10) glyph sets. These are now dynamically assigned to columns based on their depth layer, significantly improving the visual distinction between layers.
*   **Overlapping Columns:** Columns are no longer restricted to fixed slots. Their horizontal positions (`draw_x`) are randomized, allowing them to overlap, which greatly enhances the parallax and depth effect.
*   **Glyph Morphing:** Glyphs within a streak now have a chance to morph into other glyphs from their set over a short animation, adding dynamic visual interest.
*   **Varied Column Speeds:** The range of possible speeds for columns has been increased, and the speed ranges for individual depth layers have been widened. This results in more noticeable speed differences between columns and reduces "clumping."
*   **Dynamic Trail Lengths:** The length of each rain streak's trail is now randomized upon reset.

### User Interaction & Controls (Milestone 3)
*   **Density Control:** Users can now increase or decrease the number of active rain streaks on screen using the D-Pad Left/Right buttons.
*   **Speed Control:** D-Pad Up/Down adjusts the global falling speed of the glyphs.
*   **Pause/Resume:** Button A toggles freezing/unfreezing the animation.
*   **Animation Reset:** Button B resets the animation to its initial (configurable) speed and density.
*   **Configurable Start:** Initial speed and density are now configurable constants, allowing for a more impactful start to the animation.

### Performance & Refinement (Milestone 4)
*   **Code Refactoring:**
    *   The main drawing loop was simplified by introducing a `_get_drawing_glyph_data` helper function to handle morphing logic.
    *   Title screen drawing logic was broken down into smaller, more manageable helper functions (`_animate_title_letters`, `_draw_title_text_elements`, `_draw_help_text_elements`).
    *   The `full_reset_animation` function now consistently resets speed and density to initial values.
*   **Optimized Drawing:** The `draw_glyph_pixels` function uses direct Thumby display buffer manipulation for improved rendering performance.

### Next Steps
*   Continue addressing items in Milestones 2, 3, and 4, such as exploring "inverse" color themes, more advanced trail effects, and further performance profiling.
