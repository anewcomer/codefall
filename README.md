Take the red pill and dive into **Codefall**! Experience the iconic, mesmerizing digital rain from The Matrix, now flowing endlessly on your Thumby's screen. As Morpheus wisely said, "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself" – and now you can, right in the palm of your hand!

## 🚀 Features

*   **Iconic Animation:** Watch the legendary digital code "rain" down your Thumby display.
*   **Multiple Glyph Sets:** Features Katakana-inspired and abstract glyphs in small, medium, and large sizes, creating a rich, layered visual experience.
*   **Depth Simulation:** Code streaks fall at different speeds and dimness levels, giving a sense of depth and perspective.
*   **Dynamic Glyph Morphing:** Glyphs don't just fall; they can subtly morph and change, adding to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the "Matrix code."
*   **Animated Title Screen:** A cool, falling-letter title sequence ("CODEFALL") to draw you in.
*   **Interactive Controls:** You're not just a spectator! Control the flow and appearance of the Codefall.
